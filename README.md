# Backdoor-Reverse-Shell-Using-Python
This project focuses on building a functional reverse shell backdoor using Python. The solution demonstrates how a client (victim machine) can establish a connection back to a server (attacker machine), enabling remote command execution. The report outlines the design, workflow, implementation, and security considerations of this project.

The project consists of two Python scripts:

• client.py – initiates a persistent connection to the server and executes commands remotely.

• server.py – listens for incoming reverse shell connections and manages the interaction.
